# Medical Clerking Application Backend

## Project Overview

This project serves as the backend for a mobile medical clerking application designed specifically for medical students. The primary goal is to provide a digital platform for documenting patient clerkings, enhancing the learning experience and streamlining the process of medical documentation.

## Key Features

1. **Digital Clerking Documentation**: Allows medical students to create and store patient clerkings in a digital format.

2. **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for medical students.

3. **School-based Sharing**: Students can view clerkings from peers within their medical school, fostering collaborative learning.

4. **API Endpoints**: Robust API structure for creating, retrieving, and managing clerking data.

5. **User Profiles**: Personalized profiles for each medical student user.

## Planned Features

- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: An innovative feature in the pipeline to allow students to document clerkings via voice input, improving efficiency and ease of use.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Django with Django Rest Framework
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
